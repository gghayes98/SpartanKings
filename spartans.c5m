We have managed to make armors that fit well enough not to itch or irritate the brutes. For most of the time, my friends in the military tell me, they do not remove their breast plates until the battle is over. This is likely due to the fact that they often enter a combat frenzy and no longer cares for itches or pains. Higher culture is and will always be beyond their grasp."

classdescr 			"Founded in ancient Greece by two twin descendants of the legendary Herakles, the famed city-state of Sparta went on to become a military powerhouse. In 431 BC, they went to war with their city-state rivals, Athens. In 404 BC, they won this war with the help of Persia, conquering Athens. On their return to their beloved Sparta, these two Kings and their men lost their way, sailing through the Mediterranean Sea only to find themselves marooned on a strange land. Refusing to die like cowards upon a beach, the Spartan Kings once again set up the city-state of Sparta and now aim to conquer all of Elysium. ^^ The Spartan Kings army mostly consists of their powerful Spartan Hoplites, which they will continue to upgrade and reorganize as their armies grow. If they ever need more troops, they can also call upon their lower class citizens, the Perioikoi, as well as their slaves, the Helots. Even with their powerful armies, their weak cavalry and lack of range can make things difficult when sieging cities. Eventually, the Spartan Kings can beseech the gods for their favor and gain the assistance of powerful mythic units to reinforce their armies. ^^ The Spartans have always been an agricultural city-state and relied heavily on their own conquests for income and supplies. The Spartan Kings can grow wide farmlands to supply their armies but focus primarily on conquest."
classabdescr        "Receives free Spartan Youth units from the Training Grounds which can be upgraded into Spartan Hoplites. ^ Depends heavily on iron income. ^ Traditional units excel at melee combat, but struggle with magic and sieging. ^ Can recieve divine support through worship of Greek gods. ^ Large armies of Hoplites can reorganize into stronger formations."
